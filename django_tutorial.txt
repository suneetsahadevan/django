Django Tutorial:

Python Virtual environment

python3 -m venv myvenv          #Create virtual environment

source myvenv/bin/activate      #Set the virtual environment

/home/sunny/django              #we must be in the django home directory

python manage.py runserver      #run the server

django-admin startproject mysite .    #Create a project

Starting the Project https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_start_project/

Within MySite we create an application called blog

The blog must contain objects called posts.

the model can contain properties and actions

Objects are defined in models.py in the blog folder. Posts is a class with each field defined like title, author AuthenticationMiddleware
More about the field types https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/fields/#field-types


    models.CharField – this is how you define text with a limited number of characters.
    models.TextField – this is for long text without a limit. Sounds ideal for blog post content, right?
    models.DateTimeField – this is a date and time.
    models.ForeignKey – this is a link to another model.


after defining the model we need to migrate the changes to the DB

python manage.py makemigrations blog

python manage.py migrate blog

python manage.py createsuperuser
